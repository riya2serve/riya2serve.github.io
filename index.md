Hello, welcome to my page! 

I'm Riya, a 1st year MA candidate in Columbia University's Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology (E3B) department. I study hybrids, to understand how genomic architecture and conflict contribute to inviability and developmental failure. Though my current research involves plants (*Amaranthus*), I am interested in studying these phenomena in various model systems.
