Hello & welcome! 

I'm Riya, a 2nd year MA candidate in the Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology department at Columbia University. My current research combines reproductive crossing experiments, genomic sequencing, and bioinformatic analyses to map genetic incompatibilities between two economically important weedy species of Amaranthus that have recently expanded their geographic ranges and come into contact.


is focused on investigating the genetic architecture of reproductive incompatibilities in hybrids evolving from ancestors of varied sexual systems.  



te in Columbia University's Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology (E3B) department. I study hybrids, to understand how genomic architecture and conflict contribute to inviability and developmental failure. Though my current research involves plants (*Amaranthus*), I am interested in studying these phenomena in various model systems.
